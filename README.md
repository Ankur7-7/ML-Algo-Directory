# Machine-Learning-Algos
Supervised and Unsupervised Learning algorithms in MATLAB

## Description
<li> These are the vectorized implementation of some of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms built from scratch.
<li> They include regression and classification algorithms using gradient descent
and Normal equation intuitions.
<li> Neural Networks implementations have also been included with Feedforward Propagation and BackPropagation algorithms.

## Objectives
<li> It helped in getting a better intuition of some of these popular algorithms through graphs and other data visualization tools in matlab.
<li> We can use these algorithms in various ML projects by updating the data in data.txt file.
  
## Technologies Used
  <li> MATLAB
